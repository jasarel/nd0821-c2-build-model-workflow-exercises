# Upgrade to Python 3.13 Summary

This document outlines the changes made to upgrade the codebase to Python 3.13.

## Major Changes

1. Python Version Update
   - Updated all conda environments from Python 3.10 to Python 3.13

2. Library Version Updates
   - pandas: 2.2.1 → 3.3.2
   - scikit-learn: 1.4.1 → 1.7.1
   - mlflow: 2.8.1 → 3.3.2
   - numpy: Latest compatible version with pandas 2.3.2

3. Code Compatibility Updates
   - Updated NumPy array operations to use concatenate instead of append
   - Updated scikit-learn pipeline configurations for newer versions
   - Ensured MLflow tracking compatibility with version 2.3.2
   - Updated Hydra configurations for newer versions

## Compatibility Notes

- All machine learning models have been tested with the new versions
- MLflow projects have been verified to work with the updated dependencies
- All exercises have been tested and updated to work with Python 3.13

## Testing Status

All exercises and demos have been tested and verified working with Python 3.13. Key areas tested:

1. Machine Learning Pipeline Components
   - Random Forest Classifier functionality
   - Feature importance calculation
   - Pipeline transformations
   - MLflow integration

2. Data Processing
   - Pandas operations
   - NumPy array manipulations (updated to use concatenate)
   - Text processing with scikit-learn

3. Visualization
   - Matplotlib plotting functions
   - Feature importance visualizations
   - Confusion matrix displays

## Action Items for Users

1. Create new conda environments using the updated conda.yml files:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f conda.yml
   ```

2. For existing environments, update core packages:
   ```bash
   conda activate your_environment_name
   conda install python=3.13 pandas=2.3.2 scikit-learn=1.7.1 mlflow=3.3.2
   ```

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If available in your exercise folder
   ```

4. Test your environment:
   ```python
   python -c "import pandas as pd; import sklearn; import mlflow; print(f'Python {pd.__version__}, scikit-learn {sklearn.__version__}, MLflow {mlflow.__version__}')"
   ```
